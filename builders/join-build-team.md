## About Our Program
TrekCraft is the longest-running sci-fi megabuilding community in Minecraft. We create massive, detailed ships inspired by Star Trek and other sci-fi universes, with builds that take months or even years to complete.

Our Builder Program offers a structured path for talented builders to join our collaborative projects. You'll start with focused trial builds, receive mentorship from experienced team members, and gradually take on larger projects as you develop, and get to know our team.

## Who We're Looking For
We want more than just skilled builders â€” we're looking for teammates. Joining the TrekCraft build team means becoming part of a casual, collaborative crew that values creativity, communication, and community.

### Constructive, Mature, and Open-Minded
- You're open to feedback and see it as part of the creative process
- Our review style is direct, honest, and always focused on helping the team grow
- You treat others with respect and are comfortable in a group of mostly young adult builders
- You're mature enough to handle disagreements with grace and humor

### Self-Sufficient & Team-Oriented
- You can work independently, without needing constant check-ins
- You understand this is a team-first environment. We build together. We succeed together
- You're excited to contribute ideas, share WIPs, and push the project forward

### Passionate About the Project
- You're in it for the long haul. Many of our builds take months or even years to complete
- You're enthusiastic about Star Trek, TrekCraft, and the lore-inspired design work we do
- You enjoy sharing your work with the community â€” on Discord, in screenshots, on socials

### Social & Casual
- While there's no minimum activity requirement, we value folks who get involved when they can
- That could mean hopping in VC during build sessions, joining our movie nights, or just chatting in Discord
- We're not strict. We're nerds building nerdy things for fun

## Application Timeline
Here's what to expect from application to becoming a full TrekCraft builder:

### ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Application Review (1-2 weeks)
We review your application build and responses within 1-2 weeks using our evaluation rubric. We're looking for technical skill, creative vision, and alignment with our team values. If your application shows promise, you'll receive the Recruit role in Discord, and access to our Recruit channels.

### ðŸš€ Step 2: Trial Phase (4-6 weeks)
New builders start by being paired with a mentor, and given a focused, manageable project to demonstrate their skills in our collaborative environment. You'll receive:
- **Project Scope:** You'll be given a range of smaller projectsâ€”like designing a hallway, planning a deck layout, or detailing a specialty roomâ€”so you can get experience with different aspects of our builds.
- **Dedicated Mentor:** An experienced builder to guide you through our processes and standards
- **Recruit Zone:** Access to our Recruit Zone on Discord with channels to chat with the build team, ask questions, or get ideas.

Recruits in the trial phase will not be able to start solo-projects until their promotion to full builder. We want to encourage new members on the team to work collaboratively to avoid burnout, and to have more opportunity to work with different members of our build team.

> **Note:** Both application review and trial completion are evaluated using our standardized rubric to ensure fair and consistent assessment.

<summary>ðŸ“Š **Evaluation Rubric**</summary>

#### Scoring System
Each category is scored 0â€“3:
- 0 â€“ Missing or inadequate
- 1 â€“ Needs improvement
- 2 â€“ Solid effort / acceptable
- 3 â€“ Excellent / exceeds expectations

#### Evaluation Categories
- **Use of Modded Assets:** TrekCraft resource pack and modded blocks used effectively
- **Scale & Proportions:** Modern standards (3â€“5 block hallways, 3â€“4 blocks between decks)
- **Exterior Design:** Hull shape, nacelles, and Star Trek design language
- **Interior Layout:** Logical deck planning, room distribution, access flow
- **Interior Detailing:** Consistent styles, greebling, purposeful decoration
- **Key Areas Present:** Bridge, engineering, shuttlebay, quarters, etc.
- **Cohesion & Style:** Consistent style fitting current builds (Vesta, Refit, Voyager)
- **Originality & Creativity:** New ideas, clever solutions, novel block usage
- **Effort & Completion:** Polish, care, beyond half-finished shell
- **Growth Potential:** Clear potential to grow with mentorship

> Total possible score: 30 points. We're looking for potential, attitude, and team compatibility â€” not perfection!
</details>

### âœ… Step 3: Full Builder Promotion
Successful trial completion leads to full Builder status. You'll gain:
- **Axiom Training:** Access to our Axiom mod training and resources (we encourage all applicants to practice with Axiom in singleplayer first)
- **Builder Access:** Full access to our builders-only Discord channels and your own plot on the server
- **Project Freedom:** Ability to start your own builds (though we strongly recommend avoiding solo projects for at least 3-6 months)
- **Mentorship Role:** Opportunity to mentor future trial builders as you gain experience

> *Note: The timeline can vary based on project complexity and team availability. We'll keep you updated throughout the process.*

## Your Application
Ready to apply? Here's everything you need to know about submitting your application:

We want to see your best effort, regardless of experience level. Don't worry about being perfect â€” we're looking for passion, creativity, and a solid attempt that shows you understand our requirements. Take advantage of all available resources:
- Review our evaluation [rubric](#evaluation-rubric) to understand what we're looking for
- Explore existing builds on the server for ideas and reference
- Join our Discord to ask questions and get feedback
- Study our resource pack and modded blocks to understand the tools available
- Take your time and put in the effort â€” quality over speed

> **Note:** Your application must be a solo project. We do not accept group applications, and any application that appears to have been assisted by another builder will be declined.

### Application Plot System
Instead of choosing from a list of prompts, all applicants will now use our official application world. You'll download a map or Axiom blueprint containing a series of 100x100 plots, each with a specific theme such as **Tactical**, **Engineering**, **Science**, etc.

- **Your Task:** Build out your assigned plot according to its theme. You can interpret the theme however you like, and use any sci-fi inspiration (though Trek is always a safe bet!). For example, a Tactical plot could be an Armory, a Phaser Range, or any other tactical facility.
- **Room/Area Focus:** Your build should be a complete room or area, not just a single system or component.
- **Photos Required:** Submit clear photos/screenshots of your finished plot as part of your application.
- **Space Usage:** Plots don't need to be "full" (using every inch of block space), but should make good use of the area to showcase your abilities.
- **No Height Limit:** There is no vertical height limit, as long as the entire plot can be captured in a few pictures.
- **Modern Design:** Use modern layout, clear theming, and our custom blocks (not just vanilla) to demonstrate your skills.
- **Rubric Reminder:** Remember to review the [rubric](#evaluation-rubric)â€”show us a clear theme, good layout, modern design, and creative use of TrekCraft's custom assets.

If you have questions about the application world or need help getting started, reach out on Discord!

### Age Consideration
To maintain a comfortable space for all of our builders (mostly in their late teens to 30s), we limit applicants to age 16+. Maturity, respect, and communication skills are non-negotiable regardless of age.

## What If I'm Rejected or Don't Pass Trial?
We understand that rejection can be disappointing, but it's not the end of your TrekCraft journey. Here's what you should know:

### Application Rejection
If your initial application isn't accepted, you'll receive specific feedback about areas for improvement. Common reasons include:
- Build doesn't meet our size or complexity requirements
- Technical skills need development (block usage, layout planning, etc.)
- Application responses don't align with our team values
- Age requirement not met

**You can reapply after 3 months** with an improved build and application. Many successful builders were initially rejected and came back stronger.

### Trial Period Challenges
If you don't complete the trial period successfully, it's usually due to:
- Inconsistent communication or missed check-ins
- Difficulty adapting to our collaborative workflow
- Project scope not completed within timeline
- Team dynamics or maturity concerns

**You can reapply after 6 months** if you feel you've addressed the feedback and are ready to try again.

### Staying Connected
Even if you're not ready to join the build team, you're welcome to:
- Join our Discord community as a visitor
- Participate in community events and discussions
- Share your builds in our showcase channels
- Apply again when you feel ready

> *Our goal is to build a strong, collaborative team. Sometimes that means waiting for the right fit or giving applicants time to grow.*
