# TrekCraft Builder Questions & Information Guide

## For Potential Applicants

### Understanding TrekCraft's Culture

**What makes TrekCraft different from other building communities?**
- TrekCraft is the world's premiere sci-fi themed creative megabuilding server in Minecraft
- We focus on larger-than-life creations like the Enterprise-D and Millennium Falcon
- We're committed to constantly raising the bar and setting standards
- TrekCraft operates like a union - we all contribute to group projects, make textures, help new builders, etc., and in exchange, we all benefit from the community resources

**What is TrekCraft's approach to inclusivity and safety?**
- TrekCraft is a safe space for LGBTQIA2+ folk, free of harassment, bullying, and hate-speech
- We have a zero-tolerance policy for bigotry, homo/transphobia, anti-semitism, etc.
- We promote healthy constructive discussion and inclusivity
- We're drama-free - interpersonal issues should be settled at the source or with staff help

**What is TrekCraft NOT?**
- A place for negative, hateful, or bigoted people
- A place for toxic, overly political, or hateful conversations
- Your private server or personal storage
- A bubble-wrapped community - things can sting, but they should never burn

### Building Standards & Philosophy

**What are TrekCraft's core building principles?**
- Every builder does their best to learn, improve, and push boundaries
- We look at modern examples, not builds from 10 years ago
- Make builds your own with your own spin and identity, but keep them cohesive
- Two modern builds of the same era should look like they're made from the same ingredients but by different chefs

**What are the more enforced building standards?**
- Corridor widths of 3 and 4 blocks, with roofs between 3-5 blocks above
- Ship decks should aim for 4 blocks tall per deck (3 or 5 is fine for alignment)
- Planning blocks should always be used for any project
- Dead space should be filled to minimize block faces
- Proper hull-cleaning and deck planning should precede build out of systems or rooms
- Hero-builds should be accurate to what the audience knows
- Limitations on lag-heavy blocks (Item Frames, Custom Models, Doors, Redstone, Beds, etc.)
- Signage should be limited to hero areas or for planning

**What does TrekCraft NOT enforce?**
- Planning techniques - you can set your own methods and pacing
- Original builds (non-canon) have additional freedoms
- Exact methods for interiors and systems - we ask for same-era "feels the same" but you can put your own spin
- Re-using components - welcomed if the original builder is okay with it

### Project Requirements

**What makes a project a good fit for TrekCraft?**
- Multiple builders committed (not just interested) to help work on the project
- Enough reference material or new ideas to build the entire ship
- Build lead feels capable and comfortable to run the project for 2-5 years
- Build is not a copy of something we already have, or has unique elements
- Build team has the right mix of skills (deck planning, hull work, interior design, system design, etc.)
- We have the blocks needed, or you need textures/custom assets to complete it

**What are the current project limits?**
- Builders can host at most 2-active personal projects
- Must make some contribution to a group build (currently EntD_V4, EntE_V2, and EntF)
- Exceeding 2-active builds means something will need to be archived
- New projects need to be run by the Staff team

### Feedback & Growth

**How does TrekCraft handle feedback?**
- Being on TrekCraft means being open to feedback from others (positive or constructive)
- Choosing to build on TrekCraft means agreeing to be praised or questioned on your work
- Feedback shouldn't be overly positive - we avoid fake or doctored results
- Criticism should be constructive - we're all S-tier players and should hold each other to high standards
- We should never make people feel bad for not being "S-Tier" - we all have off days and room to learn

**What is TrekCraft's approach to learning and improvement?**
- We should never be looking at what we did before as a guide, but as a lesson in what worked and what didn't
- We use modern examples to indicate what is appropriate
- We maintain consistency which is one of the pillars of quality
- We improve our library of reference for both visitors and builders
- We reduce the need to "reinvent the wheel" every week
- We teach aspiring builders techniques and ideas when they're consistently displayed across the server
