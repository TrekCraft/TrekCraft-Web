# TrekCraft Builder Program Framework

Welcome to the TrekCraft Builder Program Framework. This document outlines our vision for recruiting, mentoring, and evaluating new builders to join the team.

---

## üß≠ Who We‚Äôre Looking For

We want more than just skilled builders ‚Äî we're looking for teammates.

Joining the TrekCraft build team means becoming part of a casual, collaborative crew that values creativity, communication, and community. Our builds take time, our projects are ambitious, and the culture is a big part of what makes it all work.

### ‚úÖ Constructive, Mature, and Open-Minded

- You‚Äôre **open to feedback** and see it as part of the creative process.
- Our review style is direct, honest, and always focused on helping the team grow.
- You treat others with respect and are comfortable in a group of mostly **young adult** builders.
- You‚Äôre **mature enough** to handle disagreements with grace and humor.

> _"We don‚Äôt need everyone to agree ‚Äî but we do expect everyone to listen."_

### ‚úÖ Self-Sufficient & Team-Oriented

- You can **work independently**, without needing constant check-ins or micromanagement.
- You understand this is a **team-first** environment. We build together. We succeed together.
- You‚Äôre excited to contribute ideas, share WIPs, and push the project forward ‚Äî even when it‚Äôs not your build on the line.

### ‚úÖ Passionate About the Project

- You‚Äôre **in it for the long haul.** Many of our builds take months or even years to complete.
- You‚Äôre **enthusiastic about Star Trek**, TrekCraft, and the lore-inspired design work we do.
- You enjoy **sharing your work** with the community ‚Äî on Discord, in screenshots, on socials, etc.

### ‚úÖ Social & Casual

- While there‚Äôs no minimum activity requirement, we value folks who get involved when they can.
- That could mean hopping in VC during build sessions, joining our **movie nights**, or just chatting in Discord.
- We‚Äôre not strict. We‚Äôre **nerds building nerdy things for fun**, and we love a spirited debate ‚Äî like whether transporters are murder machines (they totally are, btw).

> _"It's just a show from the 90s ‚Äî we know more now than they did then."_ üòÑ

### ‚ùå Not a Great Fit If...

- You're just looking for a place to show off your solo builds without engaging with the team.
- You can‚Äôt handle direct feedback without taking it personally.
- You‚Äôre looking for a super formal, hyper-competitive build environment.
- You struggle to respect others‚Äô time, space, or creative contributions.

### üìù Optional: Age Minimum?

To maintain a comfortable space for our current team (mostly in their late teens to 30s), we **may limit applicants to age 16+**. This isn‚Äôt a hard rule yet ‚Äî but maturity, respect, and communication skills are non-negotiable.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prompt-Based Entry System

To give structure and variety to our recruitment process, we offer a rotating set of **build prompts** that applicants can complete to showcase their creativity and fit.

### üìã Build Guidelines (Applies to All Prompts):

We expect your submission to represent your **best possible work**, regardless of experience level. Some of us have been building in Minecraft for over a decade and still find ways to grow and improve ‚Äî don‚Äôt worry about being perfect. Focus on showing us your passion, creativity, and potential.

#### Key Build Expectations:
- Use our **resource pack** and **modded blocks** thoughtfully
- Modern build practices: 
  - Hallways should be 3‚Äì5 blocks wide
  - Decks should have at least 3‚Äì4 blocks of air between them
- Reference our recent builds for stylistic guidance: **Enterprise Refit**, **Vesta**, **Voyager**
- Stay within a **manageable size** (ideal for a solo project)
- Demonstrate clear **deck planning**, **layout flow**, **interior design**, and **hull work**
- Include a few essential areas: **Bridge**, **Main Engineering**, **Shuttlebay**, **Crew Spaces**

> It can be based on an existing canon ship, or a fully original concept ‚Äî we value both creativity and fidelity.

The prompts below are **suggestions and ideas** from us. Applicants are welcome to propose original builds as long as they meet the minimum requirements above.

## üöÄ Trial Phase: Starter Build Program

To ensure new builders start with achievable, focused goals and avoid burnout from massive solo projects, TrekCraft introduces a **Trial Phase** ‚Äî a vital step before full Builder promotion.

### Purpose

- Help new builders acclimate to TrekCraft‚Äôs building style, resource pack, and modded blocks.
- Provide mentorship and feedback in a manageable scope.
- Evaluate communication, teamwork, and commitment.
- Build confidence and skills with a realistic, bite-sized project.

---

### How It Works

1. **Invitation to Trial:**  
   After passing initial application review, applicants are invited to join the Trial Phase instead of receiving full Builder status immediately.

2. **Starter Project Assignment:**  
   Builders receive a clear, limited-scope project. Examples include:  
   - A single deck or key room (e.g., engineering lab, bridge module) for an existing TrekCraft ship  
   - A small shuttle bay or escape pod module  
   - A specialty room or corridor design with detailed interior

3. **Expectations & Timeline:**  
   - Project duration: typically **2‚Äì4 weeks**  
   - Clear deliverables and milestones established upfront  
   - Quality over quantity: focus on fidelity to style, polish, and modded block usage

4. **Mentorship & Check-Ins:**  
   - Regular progress updates with assigned mentor or builder lead  
   - Opportunity for questions, guidance, and early feedback

5. **Final Review:**  
   - Completed Trial Project is reviewed using the existing rubric plus additional evaluation on communication and responsiveness  
   - Constructive feedback provided

6. **Promotion or Next Steps:**  
   - Successful trial completion leads to **full Builder promotion** and access to larger projects  
   - If additional growth is needed, mentors may extend trial, recommend training resources, or suggest additional small builds

### Additional Evaluation Criteria During Trial

In addition to build quality, reviewers will consider:

- Responsiveness to feedback and willingness to iterate  
- Communication frequency and clarity  
- Ability to meet milestones and deadlines  
- Engagement with the team and participation in group activities

---

### Benefits of the Trial Phase

- Prevents burnout by pacing new builders appropriately  
- Builds skills and confidence in a supportive environment  
- Creates stronger bonds between builders and mentors  
- Maintains project quality and team cohesion

## üîç Evaluation Rubric

This rubric is intended as a **guideline** to help evaluate prospective builders fairly and consistently. Not every category needs to be perfect ‚Äî we are looking for potential, attitude, and compatibility with the team. Builders are not expected to be masters, but they should show growth mindset, skill, and care.

### Scoring System

Each category is scored 0‚Äì3:  
- **0 ‚Äì Missing or inadequate**  
- **1 ‚Äì Needs improvement**  
- **2 ‚Äì Solid effort / acceptable**  
- **3 ‚Äì Excellent / exceeds expectations**

You may add fractional points (e.g., 2.5) for nuance.
