# TrekCraft Builder Program Framework

Welcome to the TrekCraft Builder Program Framework. This document outlines our vision for recruiting, mentoring, and evaluating new builders to join the team.

---

## 🧭 Who We’re Looking For

We want more than just skilled builders — we're looking for teammates.

Joining the TrekCraft build team means becoming part of a casual, collaborative crew that values creativity, communication, and community. Our builds take time, our projects are ambitious, and the culture is a big part of what makes it all work.

### ✅ Constructive, Mature, and Open-Minded

- You’re **open to feedback** and see it as part of the creative process.
- Our review style is direct, honest, and always focused on helping the team grow.
- You treat others with respect and are comfortable in a group of mostly **young adult** builders.
- You’re **mature enough** to handle disagreements with grace and humor.

> _"We don’t need everyone to agree — but we do expect everyone to listen."_

### ✅ Self-Sufficient & Team-Oriented

- You can **work independently**, without needing constant check-ins or micromanagement.
- You understand this is a **team-first** environment. We build together. We succeed together.
- You’re excited to contribute ideas, share WIPs, and push the project forward — even when it’s not your build on the line.

### ✅ Passionate About the Project

- You’re **in it for the long haul.** Many of our builds take months or even years to complete.
- You’re **enthusiastic about Star Trek**, TrekCraft, and the lore-inspired design work we do.
- You enjoy **sharing your work** with the community — on Discord, in screenshots, on socials, etc.

### ✅ Social & Casual

- While there’s no minimum activity requirement, we value folks who get involved when they can.
- That could mean hopping in VC during build sessions, joining our **movie nights**, or just chatting in Discord.
- We’re not strict. We’re **nerds building nerdy things for fun**, and we love a spirited debate — like whether transporters are murder machines (they totally are, btw).

> _"It's just a show from the 90s — we know more now than they did then."_ 😄

### ❌ Not a Great Fit If...

- You're just looking for a place to show off your solo builds without engaging with the team.
- You can’t handle direct feedback without taking it personally.
- You’re looking for a super formal, hyper-competitive build environment.
- You struggle to respect others’ time, space, or creative contributions.

### 📝 Optional: Age Minimum?

To maintain a comfortable space for our current team (mostly in their late teens to 30s), we **may limit applicants to age 16+**. This isn’t a hard rule yet — but maturity, respect, and communication skills are non-negotiable.

---

## 🛠️ Prompt-Based Entry System

To give structure and variety to our recruitment process, we offer a rotating set of **build prompts** that applicants can complete to showcase their creativity and fit.

### 📋 Build Guidelines (Applies to All Prompts):

We expect your submission to represent your **best possible work**, regardless of experience level. Some of us have been building in Minecraft for over a decade and still find ways to grow and improve — don’t worry about being perfect. Focus on showing us your passion, creativity, and potential.

#### Key Build Expectations:
- Use our **resource pack** and **modded blocks** thoughtfully
- Modern build practices: 
  - Hallways should be 3–5 blocks wide
  - Decks should have at least 3–4 blocks of air between them
- Reference our recent builds for stylistic guidance: **Enterprise Refit**, **Vesta**, **Voyager**
- Stay within a **manageable size** (ideal for a solo project)
- Demonstrate clear **deck planning**, **layout flow**, **interior design**, and **hull work**
- Include a few essential areas: **Bridge**, **Main Engineering**, **Shuttlebay**, **Crew Spaces**

> It can be based on an existing canon ship, or a fully original concept — we value both creativity and fidelity.

### Note on Prompts

## 🚀 Trial Phase: Starter Build Program

To ensure new builders start with achievable, focused goals and avoid burnout from massive solo projects, TrekCraft introduces a **Trial Phase** — a vital step before full Builder promotion.

### Purpose

- Help new builders acclimate to TrekCraft’s building style, resource pack, and modded blocks.
- Provide mentorship and feedback in a manageable scope.
- Evaluate communication, teamwork, and commitment.
- Build confidence and skills with a realistic, bite-sized project.

---

### How It Works

1. **Invitation to Trial:**  
   After passing initial application review, applicants are invited to join the Trial Phase instead of receiving full Builder status immediately.

2. **Starter Project Assignment:**  
   Builders receive a clear, limited-scope project. Examples include:  
   - A single deck or key room (e.g., engineering lab, bridge module) for an existing TrekCraft ship  
   - A small shuttle bay or escape pod module  
   - A specialty room or corridor design with detailed interior

3. **Expectations & Timeline:**  
   - Project duration: typically **2–4 weeks**  
   - Clear deliverables and milestones established upfront  
   - Quality over quantity: focus on fidelity to style, polish, and modded block usage

4. **Mentorship & Check-Ins:**  
   - Regular progress updates with assigned mentor or builder lead  
   - Opportunity for questions, guidance, and early feedback

5. **Final Review:**  
   - Completed Trial Project is reviewed using the existing rubric plus additional evaluation on communication and responsiveness  
   - Constructive feedback provided

6. **Promotion or Next Steps:**  
   - Successful trial completion leads to **full Builder promotion** and access to larger projects  
   - If additional growth is needed, mentors may extend trial, recommend training resources, or suggest additional small builds

---

### Additional Evaluation Criteria During Trial

In addition to build quality, reviewers will consider:

- Responsiveness to feedback and willingness to iterate  
- Communication frequency and clarity  
- Ability to meet milestones and deadlines  
- Engagement with the team and participation in group activities

---

### Benefits of the Trial Phase

- Prevents burnout by pacing new builders appropriately  
- Builds skills and confidence in a supportive environment  
- Creates stronger bonds between builders and mentors  
- Maintains project quality and team cohesion

## 🔍 Evaluation Rubric

This rubric is intended as a **guideline** to help evaluate prospective builders fairly and consistently. Not every category needs to be perfect — we are looking for potential, attitude, and compatibility with the team. Builders are not expected to be masters, but they should show growth mindset, skill, and care.

### Scoring System

Each category is scored 0–3:  
- **0 – Missing or inadequate**  
- **1 – Needs improvement**  
- **2 – Solid effort / acceptable**  
- **3 – Excellent / exceeds expectations**

You may add fractional points (e.g., 2.5) for nuance.

| Category              | Description                                                                                      | Score (0–3) |

| **Effort & Completion**  | Shows polish, care, and an effort to go beyond a half-finished shell.                          |             |
