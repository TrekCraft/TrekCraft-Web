## **The Longest-Running Sci-Fi Megabuilding Community is Growing**

After months of planning and refinement, we're excited to announce that **TrekCraft build team applications are now officially open!** 

For those who don't know us, TrekCraft is the longest-running sci-fi megabuilding community in Minecraft. We create massive, detailed ships inspired by Star Trek and other sci-fi universes ‚Äî builds that take months or even years to complete. Our projects are collaborative, our community is tight-knit, and our standards are high.

## **What Makes TrekCraft Special?**

We're not just another building server. We're a **team-first community** where builders work together on massive collaborative projects. Our builds aren't just pretty ‚Äî they're designed to work, respect Star Trek canon, and push the boundaries of what's possible in Minecraft.

Some highlights of what we do:
- **Massive scale builds** (500+ meter ships with dozens of decks)
- **Lore-accurate designs** that respect Star Trek canon
- **Custom resource pack** with thousands of Star Trek-themed blocks
- **Long-term projects** that take months or years to complete
- **Collaborative environment** where we build together, learn together, and grow together

## **Our New Builder Program**

We've structured our recruitment process to be fair, transparent, and focused on building a strong team. Here's what the program looks like:

### **Phase 1: Application (1-2 weeks review)**
- Build 6+ themed plots using our 1.21.1 modpack
- Submit solo application with screenshots
- Evaluated using our 30-point rubric (20+ to pass)
- If accepted ‚Üí Recruit role in Discord

### **Phase 2: Trial Period (4-6 weeks)**

- Collaborative work only (no solo projects initially)
- Work with different team members to gain experience
- Evaluated using the same rubric system

### **Phase 3: Full Builder**
- Access to Axiom mod training and resources
- Full Discord access and your own plot on the server
- Can start solo projects (though we recommend waiting 3-6 months)
- Opportunity to become a liaison for future recruits

## **Who We're Looking For**

- **Age 16+** with maturity and communication skills

- **Long-term commitment** (our projects take months or years)
- **Passion for Star Trek** and sci-fi building
- **Open to feedback** and collaborative work

## **The Application Process**

### **What We Evaluate**
Our standardized rubric looks at 10 categories:

- Exterior and interior design
- Cohesion and style consistency
- Originality and creativity
- Effort and completion quality
- Growth potential and team compatibility

**Total possible score: 30 points. We're looking for potential, attitude, and team compatibility ‚Äî not perfection!**

## **Why This Matters**

This isn't just another recruitment drive. We're building something special here ‚Äî a community of builders who are passionate about sci-fi, committed to quality, and excited to work together on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in Minecraft.

Our builds aren't just impressive ‚Äî they're meaningful. They respect the source material, they're designed to be functional, and they're created by a team that genuinely cares about the work we do.

## **A Note About Our Approach**

We know this entire process may seem daunting, or even silly to some. We get it. But we also know that the builders who thrive in TrekCraft are the ones who see this as more than just building in Minecraft ‚Äî they see it as being part of something special.

We're not looking for perfection. We're looking for passion, creativity, and a genuine desire to be part of our community. We're looking for builders who want to grow, who want to collaborate, and who are excited about the work we do.

If that sounds like you, we can't wait to see your application.

**Live long and prosper! üññ**
